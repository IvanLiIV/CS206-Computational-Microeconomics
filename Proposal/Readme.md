## Research Background and Motivation
The motivation behind this study stems from the need to bridge the gap in current economic trust assessments, which do not fully account for the complexities introduced by digital platforms and AI interactions. This research explores how Large Language Models can dynamically assess and predict trust, transforming traditional economic interactions.

## Detailed Research Components

### Introduction to the Problem
The economic interactions in digital spaces are fraught with challenges such as information asymmetry and incomplete trust. This project investigates how LLMs can be utilized to mitigate these issues through enhanced trust assessments.

### Research Objectives
- **Question 1:** How can LLMs be utilized to assess trust dynamically in economic interactions?
- **Question 2:** What impacts do LLM-informed decisions have on the fairness and transparency of market interactions?

### Importance of the Study
These questions are critical as they address the integration of advanced AI in economic theories and practices, aiming to revolutionize traditional models by providing deeper insights and more reliable trust assessments.

### Gaps in Current Literature
While traditional economic models offer robust frameworks, they often fail to capture the dynamic and complex nature of modern economic interactions, especially those involving AI. This study aims to fill this gap by applying LLMs to understand and predict human and AI behavior in trust-based games.

## Preliminary Results and Insights
The initial simulations demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enhance trust predictions, leading to improved cooperation rates and reduced conflicts in simulated economic scenarios.

## Future Directions and Impact
This research opens pathways for future investigations into the scalability of LLM applications in diverse economic settings and their potential to inform policy-making and strategic economic decisions.
