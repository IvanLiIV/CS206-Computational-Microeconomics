## Question 1: Behavioral Game Theory and oTree

oTree is a widely used platform for designing and implementing interactive decision experiments in experimental economics, such as the trust game. My personal experience with deploying the trust game using oTree revealed its user-friendly interface and flexible design options. However, there are several limitations that affect its efficiency and accessibility. For instance, handling large numbers of participants can cause performance issues, and the platform lacks efficient real-time data processing capabilities, which are essential for adjusting experimental parameters dynamically based on participant responses. Additionally, customization in oTree requires significant programming knowledge, which can be a barrier for researchers without a technical background.

Based on literature and class discussions, experimental economics aims to understand strategic interactions and market mechanisms in controlled environments. To address the limitations of oTree and better meet these goals, I propose a new software solution that offers enhanced scalability through a distributed computing architecture, real-time adaptive experimentation capabilities, and a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface for experiment design. These improvements will allow the software to support larger and more complex studies, facilitate dynamic interaction studies that reflect real-world scenarios more accurately, and make the tool more accessible to a wider range of researchers, including those without programming skills.

The advancements in this new software are crucial for experimental economics. They enable the inclusion of more participants in broader studies, allow for more dynamic and interactive decision-making processes, and expand access to experimental design tools across various disciplines. This will foster more robust, inclusive, and dynamic research methodologies, significantly contributing to the field.

## Question 2: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

Current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks face several limitations that hinder their effectiveness in complex strategic environments. These limitations include restrictive environment constraints that limit the scenarios agents can effectively learn from and inflexibilities in algorithm customization that stifle innovation in agent strategies. Using the Trust Game as an example, these issues become particularly evident.

In the Trust Game, two players decide sequentially on the distribution of an endowment. The first player, the "trustor," decides how much of their endowment to send to the second player, the "trustee." The amount sent is tripled, and the trustee then decides how much to return to the trustor. The development process of a MARL agent for the Trust Game involves defining states, actions, and rewards. States are represented by the amount of endowment and the history of previous moves, actions are the possible amounts the trustor can send and the trustee can return, and rewards are calculated based on the final payoff to each player.

My personal attempt to deploy the Trust Game using a MARL framework highlighted several issues. The predefined environment settings were too rigid, making it difficult to adjust the game's parameters (like endowment size or multiplication factor) dynamically based on evolving agent strategies. Additionally, customizing agent algorithms to incorporate complex strategies or learn from past interactions was overly complicated due to the limited flexibility in the framework's design.

To overcome these limitations and advance MARL, I propose the following enhancements:

- **Dynamic Environment Customization:** Implement frameworks that allow for easier modification of environment parameters. This would enable researchers to test a wider range of scenarios and conditions, making the simulations more robust and generalizable.
- **Enhanced Algorithm Customization:** Develop tools that simplify the integration of custom algorithms and learning strategies. This could involve more modular framework designs where components like learning rules or reward functions can be easily swapped or adjusted.
- **Intuitive Interaction Modeling:** Facilitate better modeling of complex interactions and strategies by incorporating more sophisticated behavioral assumptions into the agent design process. This could involve integrating findings from behavioral economics to better simulate human-like decision-making.

These enhancements would enable MARL to be more adaptable and applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios, fostering greater innovation and effectiveness in the development of autonomous agents. They would also make the technology more accessible to researchers from various fields, thereby encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and driving further advancements in MARL.
